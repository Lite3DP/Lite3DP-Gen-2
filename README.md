# Lite3DP Gen 2

![CAMP-8-pledge2a](https://github.com/Lite3DP/Lite3DP-Gen-2/assets/70020406/fe4fda94-f0a0-4a23-88a9-63add3b5ac06)

Hi everyone! Thanks for stopping by here!

We are delighted to introduce the new Lite3DP Gen 2. We will be here expanding and improving the open source documentation, with a focus on the study, modification, improvement and repair of the kits and pre-assembled machines offered on [Crowd Supply](https://www.crowdsupply.com/lite3dp/lite3dp-gen-2).

Due to the need to introduce custom components and more complex manufacturing processes, we have moved slightly away from the strong DIY imprint of the S1 model, in which all the components are standard and the soldering with through-hole. However, for those enthusiasts who want to build an entirely Gen 2-style machine (OLED auxiliary display suggested), below we list non-standard components and possible adaptations/solutions.

1. SMD soldering.
Most electronic components are no longer through-hole and surface mount must be performed. It's not as simple as with a soldering iron, but you can order a stencil along with the PCBs, use solder paste and an electric oven or heat gun to achieve reflow. Please research this topic carefully.

2. Stepper motor.
We incorporate a custom stepper motor: Nema 8 with built-in T3.5 leadscrew, 128mm long. This is not a standard motor, but it is common to find a 100mm long leadscrew, which you can use only by giving up a few millimeters of build height.
   
3. LCD display.
We use a non-standard LCD display, with custom FPC cable and protective glass. You can get it as a spare part on [Crowd Supply](https://www.crowdsupply.com/lite3dp/lite3dp-gen-2).
   
4. Linear guide.
Like the stepper motor leadscrew, the 115mm length of the linear guide is not common, but you can use 100mm length.
   
5. Aluminum light cone.
The original cone is made from aluminum, offering a large additional heat dissipation surface area. Use the plastic model with caution that the LCD display does not exceed 60Â°C. You can apply aluminum film inside and reduce the power of UV light.
    
6. Resin vat / build platform.
Resin vat can be made of plastic only in PLA and PP since other materials chemically react with resins. In the plastic alternative resin vat design, the Gerber of an aluminum PCB is included from which it can be cut out and obtain the vat frame and the surface of the build platform. This way it is not necessary to order metal cutting parts, and they can be ordered together with the PCBs.
