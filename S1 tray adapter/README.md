The S1 resin tray adapter can be printed on the S1 itself or on a filament 3D printer as well.
Please print two units, one for each side of the tray. 
You will additionally need 4 M3x8 button head screws and 4 M3 nuts.
Please note that the S1 build platform is perfectly compatible with the new Gen 2 PCBs.
